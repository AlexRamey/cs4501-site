To see the load-balancer in action:

Step 1: Run docker-compose up to start up the web app.
    Notes:
            - There are now 2 web containers
            - The abr8xq/haproxy image should be pulled down from docker hub on first run
            - This will also start up the haproxy container (with links to the two web containers)

Step 2: Open the browser and go to 0.0.0.0:8005/isa_web (haproxy listens on port 8005 will route you to one of the web containers)
